IMAGE COMPRESSION USING FUZZY LOGIC

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Image compression is a technique in which large amount of disk space is required for the raw images which seems to be a very big disadvantage during transmission and storage. With increase in technology an efficient technique for image compression is needed. Even though there are so many compression techniques , but there comes a need for better compression technique which is faster, memory efficient and simply suits the requirements of the user.

OBJECTIVE:
Our objective is to obtain better quality of image with no loss or minimal loss of data as well as the compressed image. This can be achieved by fuzzy logic with Huffman coding. Huffman coding technique is good compression technique in lossless image compression and the coding redundancy can be eliminated by assigning the codes in better way.

PROPOSED:
We proposed a simple lossless data compression algorithm that uses multiple Huffman coding tables. The type used in this compression is lossless compression which means when the data are compressed there will be no loss of information. When processed in the logic block the compressed data is decompressed and each and every data are processed and are provided in the output.
